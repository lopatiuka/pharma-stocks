                                    COVID-19 is no different. What is 
                                    different is the speed at which pharmaceutical innovation happens and solutions are found. Within 
                                    less than a year, there are 5 major healthcare providers gearing up with a vaccine solution to the 
                                    COVID-19 problem. That alone, is a phenomenally short time span of success in the industry.<br>

                                            Human ailments are not something new. Where there are humans, there’s a need for treatments, 
                                            medicines and therapies. Pharmaceutical companies have been around for hundreds of years, from 
                                            the year 1668 to be exact! So this happens to be one of the oldest (and strongest) industries 
                                            around. How strong? <span class = "bold-text">About $1.9 Trillion strong by 2027!</span><br>
                                            <br>
                                            So the industry itself isn’t new, what is new, is the speed of innovation that these companies 
                                            bring to the table nowadays. Speed and expertise that have seen their shares skyrocket, 
                                            consistently, year-on-year. Healthcare, like food, water and shelter is now a basic human 
                                            necessity.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In the meantime, all these giant healthcare providers are trading on the open stock exchange, 
                                            innovating and coming up with solutions in half the time; to eradicate diseases such 
                                            as COVID-19. As we write, there are currently 5 global companies gearing up to supply vaccines 
                                            and control the outbreak. They have all achieved this in less than a year, that is record 
                                            time!<br>
                                            <br>
                                            As long as humans exist, viruses will evolve, and pharmaceutical improvements will be necessary.
                                            As long as global populations rise there will be a need for proper medication, therapies and 
                                            treatments. This need will only increase and so will the value of the Healthcare Stocks.
